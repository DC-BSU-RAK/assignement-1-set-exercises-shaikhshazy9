            <p>Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White, a struggling and depressed high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with stage-3 lung cancer.</p>
            <p>To secure his family's financial future before he dies, Walter turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, to produce and distribute crystal meth. The show explores how a fatal diagnosis releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild-mannered family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.</p>
